# Machine Learning Codes

The main idea of this repository is to provide the codes and other relevant information to be able to perform the activities of the course.

Our template leverages a Makefile to automate various tasks associated with setting up and maintaining a data science project environment. The Makefile is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of managing dependencies, virtual environments, and other routine tasks, allowing you to focus on the core aspects of your data analysis.

## Prerequisites

- [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  - Optional

## Quick Start âš¡

## Windows Installation

For window users, please install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and then execute the following command in the cmd.exe as administrator to install the packages:

```sh
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
This instruction will install the Chocolatey package manager in your computer.

Then, install the make package with the following command:
